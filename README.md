The Html class provides some useful functions for when working with HTML.

## Installation

To install this package

```linux
$ composer require originphp/html
```

## From Text

If you need to convert a text block to html

```php
$text = <<< EOF
This is a paragrpah.
This is another line part of the paragraph.

This is a new paragraph.
EOF;
$html = Html::fromText($text);
```

This will create:

```html
<p>This is a paragrpah.<br>This is another line part of the paragraph.</p>
<p>This is a new paragraph.</p>
```

If want paragraphs to be wrapped with a different tag than `p` then would do so like this

```php
$html = Html::fromText($text,['tag'=>'div']);
```

## To Text

To convert HTML to formatted text

```php
$text = Html::toText($html);
```

For example

```php
$html = <<< EOF

Using Google API
----------------

You can use the [Google API](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-php-client/tree/master/examples) to access various Google services.

To install the library:

composer require google/apiclient:^2.0

Create a file called quickstart.php and add the following contents

     require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
     
     if (php_sapi_name() != 'cli') {
         throw new Exception('This application must be run on the command line.');
     }
     ... truncated
     
```

To create text version without formatting:

```php
$text = Html::toText($html,['format'=>false]);
```
The main difference is headings, tables, code etc are not formatted. The HTML is cleaned up, line breaks are added, and lists are converted. If a list has a sublist then indentation will be added.

> For security reasons text will be escaped first, if you don't want this behavior then pass the options array with the key escape, and set to false.

## Minify

Minify cleans up the spacing, removes comments and thus minifies a HTML string.

```php
$minified = Html::minify($html);
```


## Sanitize

Sanitize enables to only allow certain tags and attributes in a Html string.

```php
$html = Html::sanitize($html,[
    'h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4', 'h5', 'h6',
    'p',
    'i', 'em', 'strong', 'b', 'blockquote', 'del',
    'a' => ['href'],
    'ul', 'li', 'ol', 'br',
    'code', 'pre',
    'img' => ['src','alt']]
    );
```


## Strip Tags

To strip selected tags and their content from a HTML string, in other words strip tags that are in a blacklist

```php
$html = Html::stripTags($html,['script','iframe','img']);
```

## Escape

It is important when displaying user inputted HTML that it is escaped properly for security reasons, see [Cross-site scripting](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/learning/xss/) for more information.

```php
echo Html::escape($html);
```
